<p><strong>6. Important Information About Platform Permissions</strong></p>
<p>Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without your consent. &nbsp;And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. &nbsp;The iOS platform will alert you the first time the ProSport.Guru Inc app wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. &nbsp;Android devices will notify you of the permissions that the ProSport.Guru Inc app seeks before you first use the app, and your use of the app constitutes your consent. &nbsp;Sometimes these permissions require more explanation than the platforms themselves provide, and the permissions we request will change over time, so we&rsquo;ve created these pages to serve as authoritative and up-to-date resources for our users. &nbsp;To learn about the platform-level permissions that the app seeks, please visit our new iOS Permissions page and Android Permissions page.</p>

<p>6.1 Android Devices</p>
<p>Android is a privilege-separated operating system, in which each application runs with a distinct system identity. &nbsp;A central design point of the Android security architecture is that no application, by default, has permission to perform any operations that would adversely impact other applications, the operating system, or the user. &nbsp;This includes reading or writing the user&apos;s private data (such as contacts or emails), reading or writing another application&apos;s files, performing network access, keeping the device awake, and so on.</p>
<p>A basic Android application has no permissions associated with it by default, meaning it cannot do anything that would adversely impact the user experience or any data on the device.&nbsp;</p>

<p>6.2 &nbsp; iPhone</p>
<p>System security is designed so that both software and hardware are secure across all core components of every iOS device. &nbsp;This includes the boot-up process, software updates, and Secure Enclave. &nbsp;This architecture is central to security in iOS, and never gets in the way of device usability. &nbsp;The tight integration of hardware and software on iOS devices ensures that each component of the system is trusted and validates the system as a whole. &nbsp;From initial boot-up to iOS software updates to third-party apps, each step is analyzed and vetted to help ensure that the hardware and software are performing optimally together and using resources properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple regularly releases software updates to address emerging security concerns and also provide new features; these updates are provided for all supported devices simultaneously. &nbsp;Users receive iOS update notifications on the device and through iTunes, and updates are delivered wirelessly, encouraging rapid adoption of the latest security fixes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To protect your iPhone&nbsp;against any threats, you need to make sure you&rsquo;re running the latest version of Apple&rsquo;s&nbsp;operating system&nbsp;&ndash; iOS 10.1.1 as of November 1, 2016.</p>

<p><strong>7. International Users</strong></p>

<p><strong>8. Privacy Protection for Children</strong></p>

<p>?&ldquo;Internet tags&quot; (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell the app server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor&apos;s computer. &nbsp;This App uses Internet tags.??&ldquo;Navigational data&quot; (&quot;log files,&quot; &quot;server logs,&quot; and &quot;clickstream&quot; data) and &quot;Internet Tags&quot; are used for system management, to improve the content of the site, market research purposes, and to communicate information to visitors. &nbsp;This App uses navigational data.</p>

<p><strong>11. What Safeguards Are in Place to Protect My Data?</strong></p>
<p>While no app can promise complete security, we have incorporated the latest, technical, and physical security procedures designed to protect your personal data. &nbsp;We secure data of users on our app by using SSL 2048 encryption which is the high-security industry standard. &nbsp;We employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information. &nbsp;Our firewalls protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.&nbsp;</p>
